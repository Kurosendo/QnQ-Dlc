        <li>questDescription->[descriptionIntro] looking to expand their territory, and are interested in taking over [playerSettlements] with all [itsTheir] wealth and technology. If you can increase your total wealth to [requiredWealth_money], they will take the [settlementsSingularOrPlural].\n\nIn trade, they offer you part of a map showing the location of an ancient archotech nexus. The archonexus is thought to be a conduit through which an archotech superintelligence influences the physical world. If you could invoke its power, what happens next could go beyond physical reality.\n\n[onlyHaveHas] one piece of the map. The other parts are held by other factions.\n\nIf you accept their offer, the [factionPawnsPlural] will take possession of [playerSettlements], including all items, people, and recorded research. They'll bring [colonistsAllowed] of your people and [animalsAllowed] of your animals to anywhere you want on the planet to start a new colony.\n\nLater, you can trade with others for the final two parts of the map.</li>

        <li>questDescription->With the first archonexus map part securely recorded, you prepare for the next step of your journey.\n\n[cycle1Faction] told you of the cataclysm that destroyed this world. Humans built a great thinking machine here centuries ago. It turned against the people and there was a great war. Only a few were left when the machine transcended and fell dormant.\n\nThe map to the archonexus has three parts, and you hold one of them. [otherMapPartHolders] also each hold parts of the map. They'll trade their parts to you for a wealthy new colony and all of its recorded research.[descriptionStudyRequirement]\n\nIt's time to get building.</li>
